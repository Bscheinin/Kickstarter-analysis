# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns using Excel

## Overview of Project
This project used an Excel database of Kickstarter entertainment funding programs to analyze trends and create visualizations of the data to assist a producer in decision making.

### Purpose
The goal of this project was to use Kickstarter data to determine future strategies for crowdfunding musical theater productions. Analysis of the data using Excel formulas and visualization tools allowed identification of trends and ulimately recommendations to be delivered to producer Louise.  

## Analysis and Challenges
The Kickstarter dataset is large and contains data related to crowdfunding campaigns in the areas of film & video, food, games, journalism, music, photography, publishing, technology and theater. This dataset looked at campaigns from 2009 to 2017. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Musical theater productions typically run on a seasonal bases. Crowdfunding for successful musical theater productions also have a seasonal characteristic. The ![Outcomes Based on Launch Date](https://........) chart shows the number of successful campaigns by the month in which they were launched. The highest number of successful theater production campaigns were launched in May and June. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The Kickstarter dataset included funding goals and the sucess rate. As Louise was interested in musical theater plays, the ![Outcomes Based on Goal](https://.....) chart shows the funding ranges and the success rate of theater play campaigns. Fifty percent or more of funding campaigns were successful if the goal was leass than $20,000, the success rate rising as the goal decreased. There were also successful campaigns of 50% or more in the rant of $35,000 to $45,000. Further analysis for Louise on these higher funded projects by number of donors and average donation would be helpful.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
This dataset was large. To make the data meaningful for Louise, data cleaning meant filtering data to reflect her area of interest along with formatting to allow for targeted analysis. For instance, the campaign dates were listed in Unix Timestamps and which were more readable if changed using this formula '=(((J2/60)/60)/24)+DATE(1970,1,1)'. In addition, of the 4,113 funding campaigns, only about 1,000 of those were for plays. Collecting additional data from another crowdfunding system specifically for plays may provide more data for Louise.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
